# View 360 Diagram

## Overview

This component allows visualizing all relations of a particular Item with the other Items in the catalog, regardless of its type and to explore the graph of relations in an incremental way (semantic relations, between Datasets and Fields, etc.).

This component can be used on the Studio and the Explorer in the **View 360** section.
