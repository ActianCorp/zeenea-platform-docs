# Catalog API v2

Zeenea offers a GraphQL API for integrating the data catalog into your data ecosystem. Thanks to this API, you can query or mutate the metadata stored in the data catalog.

Full documentation of this API is available at [https://docs.zeenea.com/](https://docs.zeenea.com/).
 
Zeenea also makes available the GraphiQL tool, enabling you to test your queries from the browser, at [https://.zeenea.app/api/catalog](https://.zeenea.app/api/catalog).

GraphQL is the GraphQL integrated development environment (IDE). It provides syntax highlighting and auto-completion, making it easy to get to grips with GraphQL syntax and discover the API.

Access to GraphQL is restricted to catalog users, and the permissions applied are those of your user in Zeenea Explorer and Studio. It does not require any API key.
