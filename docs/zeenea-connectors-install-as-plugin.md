# Installing and Configuring Connectors as a Plugin

## Introduction

Zeenea next generation connectors are now available as plugins! This new approach allows for an easier installation, as well as a speedier roll-out of new versions and features. 

## Installation Procedure

Follow these steps to install or update your plugin connector:

1. Download the latest version of the connector through the communicated link.
2. Stop the scanner.
3. Move the downloaded file `connector-plugin-1.0.zip` directly in the `plugins` folder of your scanner. Do not unzip the archive.
4. In case of an update, be sure to delete the older version of the plugin before the operation (zip file and folder).
5. In case of installing a new connector, be sure to configure this new connector correctly as specified in its dedicated documentation. You can find a list of links to all our connection configuration documentation here: [Connector Downloads](./zeenea-connectors-list.md).
6. Restart the scanner.
