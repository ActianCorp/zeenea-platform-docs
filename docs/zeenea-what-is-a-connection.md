# What is a Connection?

A Connection represents a system to which Zeenea is connected. It allows the scanner to retrieve metadata from your information source with which you are connected and incorporate them into Zeenea. 

Connections are therefore associated with specific solutions (Oracle, Teradata, HDFS, Amazon S3, Table, Power BI...) through [Zeenea connectors](./zeenea-connectors-list.md).
